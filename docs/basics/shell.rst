Directories

File and directory paths in UNIX use the forward slash "/" 
to separate directory names in a path.

Change to your home folder. Same as ``cd ~/`` or ``cd /Users/<yourusername>/``

::

    cd

::

    cd ~/code/

::

    cd ~/Desktop
  
etc


Listing
-------

``man ls`` to show all options :)

Examples
""""""""

::

    # list current directory | ls: "list"
    ls

::

    # long format | ls: "list long"
    ls -l

::

    # show hidden files | ls: "list long and show all"
    ls -la

::

    # list specific folder
    ls -l ~/code/




Move, copy, rename, create
--------------------------


Examples
""""""""


::

    # create directory | mkdir: "make directory"
    mkdir documents
    
    # create empty file
    touch file.txt

::

    # rename file | mv: "move"
    mv file.txt file_new.txt
    
    # and back..
    mv file_new.txt file.txt
    
::

    # copy file | cp: "copy"
    cp file.txt documents/file.txt

::

    # delete file | rm: "remove"
    rm file.txt
    
    # delete folder | rm -R: "remove recursively"   -   (-R = Recursive - CAREFULL!!)
    rm -R documents/
    
    # delete folder (works only if empty) | rmdir: "remove directory"
    rmdir documents



Viewing files

    # like dump, additional up/down with cursor
    less file.txt

    
::

    # shows the last few lines of a file
    tail file.txt
    
    # usefull to watch logfiles.. -f for "follow"
    tail -f /var/log/system.log
    tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
